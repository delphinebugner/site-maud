title: Maud Haering
subtitle: Soprano
description: Applauded in March and August 2019 for her interpretation of the
  role of Iole in the French premiere of Nicola Porpora's serenade "Deianira,
  Iole ed Ercole", the French soprano Maud Haering already has a large number of
  concerts to her credit in France and throughout Europe. With the Parnasso in
  Festa ensemble, of which she is a founding member, she has brought this
  forgotten serenade to audiences in Normandy and Gironde during the Flam' and
  Musicales du Bocage festivals. The young soprano then performed the cantata
  BWV 51 'Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen' in The Hague in February 2020 as part
  of the Early Music Open Stage of the Koninklijk Conservatorium.
