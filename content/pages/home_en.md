subtitle: Soprano
description: The French soprano Maud Haering has been passionate about early
  music repertoires for many years. As a member of both medieval and baroque
  music ensembles, she works regularly abroad with the *Amsterdam Baroque Choir*
  (conducted by Ton Koopman) and the *Collegium Vocale* in Ghent (conducted by
  Philippe Herreweghe). Since January 2022, she has also sung under the
  direction of Sébastien Daucé in numerous concerts with the ensemble
  *Correspondances (Charpentier's David et Jonathas*, Le Sacre de Louis XIV, Le
  concert secret des Dames, Vox Angelorum, Septem membra Jesu nostri) and will
  shortly begin working with the chamber choir *Les Éléments* (Lully's *Armide*
  at the Opéra Comique) and the ensemble Jacques Moderne, both conducted by Joël
  Suhubiette. The young soprano also performs regularly with the medieval music
  ensembles *Discantus* and *Alla Francesca* (dir. Brigitte Lesnes),
  *Arborescence* (dir. David Chappuis), *Sine Cum* and *Palin(e)* in polyphonic
  and monodic repertoire from the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries.
