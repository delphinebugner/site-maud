description: French soprano Maud Haering has been passionate about early music
  repertoires for many years. A member of both medieval and baroque music
  ensembles, she works regularly abroad with the Amsterdam Baroque Choir
  (conducted by Ton Koopman) and the Collegium Vocale in Ghent (conducted by
  Philippe Herreweghe). Since January 2022, she has also sung under the
  direction of Sébastien Daucé in numerous concerts with the ensemble
  Correspondances (Charpentier's David et Jonathas, Le Sacre de Louis XIV, Le
  concert secret des Dames, Vox Angelorum, Septem membra Jesu nostri), and has
  recently begun working with the chamber choir Les Éléments (Lully's Armide at
  the Opéra Comique) and the ensemble Jacques Moderne, both conducted by Joël

  ensembles Discantus and Alla Francesca (dir. Brigitte Lesnes), Arborescence
  (dir. David Chappuis), Sine Cum and Palin(e) in polyphonic and monodic
  repertoires from the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries.
